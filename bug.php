This code attempts to access an array element using a non-integer key. In PHP, array keys are typically integers (for numerically indexed arrays) or strings (for associative arrays).  Using a floating-point number or a boolean value as a key will lead to unexpected behavior.  PHP may issue a warning or may silently coerce the key into an integer, leading to subtle and hard-to-debug errors.

```php
$myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
$index = 1.5; // Problem: Floating-point key
$value = $myArray[$index];
echo $value; // Might output 'b' or issue a warning
```
